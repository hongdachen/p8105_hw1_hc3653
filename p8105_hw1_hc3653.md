# Probem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

### The variables

This dataset contains variables of origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

### The size

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

### The mean temperature

The mean temperature is 39.58

### PLot and descriptions

``` r
library(ggplot2)

temp_time <-
  ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
       geom_point() +
       labs( title = "Temperature vs Time Hour",
             x = "Time_Hour",
             y = "Temperature")
print(temp_time)
```

![](未命名_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- --> From the
plot, we can see that from early to mid-january, the temperature shows
an increasing trend overall. However, the daily temperature fluctuates
between day and night. When the temperature is higher, the humidity is
also higher, therefore there is a positive relationship between
temperature and humidity.

``` r
ggsave(filename = "temp_vs_time.png",
       plot = temp_time )

As we can see from the result, it works for random sample and logical
vector, but neither for character vector nor factor vector.

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.03598041

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, norm_samp_pos))

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
as.numeric(p2_df$norm_samp_pos)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(p2_df$vec_factor)
```

For the logical vector, the function converts “TRUE” to 1 and “FALSE” to
0, since the logical values are internally stored as 0 and 1 in R. This
explains why we can get the mean of logical vectors.

For the vector character, the result shows NA, becuase each character is
unique and there are so many characters so that characters can’t be
converted to numerical numbers. So even by using the pull function, we
still can’t get the mean.

For the vector factor, they are stored as integers in R. For example,
they can be converted to 1, 2 and etc according to levels assigned. But
we need to apply the as.numeric function to accomplish this conversion,
otherwise factors are not numerical numbers, thus we can’t have the mean
of it.
